## Data Visualization

- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) - Simple and easy to use
- [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) - My preferred visualization library: highly customizable with a great variety of chart types
- [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) - Built on top of matplotlib, default themes are bit more visually appealing. *You will need to know a bit about matplotlib to use it*.
- [Plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine) - Python implementation of ggplot2, based on The Grammar of Graphics
- [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) - Go to for interactive visualizations
- [Pygal](https://github.com/Kozea/pygal) - Great for small datasets as you can export as SVG. Easy to make nice looking charts with built in styles.
