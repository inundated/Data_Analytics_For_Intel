## Data Visualization

- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) - Simple and easy to use
- [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) - My preferred visualization library: highly customizable with a great variety of chart types
- [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) - Built on top of matplotlib, default themes are bit more visually appealing. *You will need to know a bit about matplotlib to use it*.
- [Plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine) - Python implementation of ggplot2, based on The Grammar of Graphics
- [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) - Go to for interactive visualizations
- [Pygal](https://github.com/Kozea/pygal) - Great for small datasets as you can export as SVG. Easy to make nice looking charts with built in styles.
- [Altair](https://pypi.org/project/altair/) - Good visuals with minimal code
- [Geoplotlib](https://github.com/andrea-cuttone/geoplotlib) - Really great maps w/ openGL and runs well even with large datasets
- [Gleam](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gleam) - Inspired by the Shiny package for R and great for quickly building lightwweight data web apps

## Web Scraping
- [Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) - You will need this for making any sort of HTTP or API requests. It should probably be the very first library you download
- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - Start here and use it with requests and lxml, it will do most of what you need
- [lxml](https://github.com/lxml/lxml) - lxml is absolutely necessary to use with beautiful soup to parse XML and HTML
- [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) - Extremely powerful and customizable
- [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) - Absolutely necessary if you need to scrape data from website that use JavaScript to present items on the website

## GUI
- [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - Pretty easy to get started with and great when you need to create an applciation with an interface
- [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) - Allows you to build mobile applications with touch interfaces. Actually very easy to use and make your first mobile app
- [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) - Offers the ability to drag and drop elements to create your interface using the QtGUI
- [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) - Maybe the fastest way to create a data driven app
