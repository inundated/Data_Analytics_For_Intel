## Books

I really only use 2 books regularly for data analysis:
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) - Written by Wes McKinney who wrote the pandas library for Python and co-created Arrow and Ibis. The entire book is available for free on McKinney's site but I highly recommend buying it. If you ever pick up a single book for data analysis and python, it should be this one.
- [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/) - Written by Joel Grus, this book really helped me beging to understand the fundamentals behind data science and be more comfortable with the logic and math.

Others:
- [Numsense! Data Science for the Layman: No Math Added](https://www.amazon.com/Numsense-Data-Science-Layman-Added-ebook/dp/B01N29ZEM6) - By Annalyn Ng and Kenneth Soo, it's a great way to introduce yourself to data science.
- [A Practitionerâ€™s Guide to Business Analytics](https://www.amazon.com/PRACTITIONERS-GUIDE-BUSINESS-ANALYTICS-Organizations/dp/0071807594) - By Randy Bartlett, I have this on my reading list. It covers integrating analytics into your business's strategic process.
